I'm a Front-End Software Engineering student at ALX, driven by a passion for creating intuitive and visually stunning web applications. My journey into software engineering began with a desire to solve real-world problems through code and design. I’m inspired by the endless possibilities of front-end development, from building responsive layouts to optimizing user interactions.
